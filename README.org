* Overview
This repository uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to manage dotfiles. Stow creates symbolic links
from this directory to your home directory, keeping your configurations
organized and version-controlled.

* Directory Structure
Each top-level directory represents a "package." For example, here's the
baseline at the time of writing this README:

| Program | Description                               |
|---------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~doom~    | Emacs configuration                       |
| ~git~     | Git global configuration                  |
| ~ispell~  | Dictionary and spellcheck settings        |
| ~skhd~    | macOS hotkey daemon configuration         |
| ~yabai~   | macOS tiling window manager configuration |
| ~zsh~     | Shell configuration and plugins           |

* Quick Start (Bootstrap)
For a fresh installation, run the provided bootstrap script. It will check for
Stow and link all packages automatically.

#+begin_src bash
chmod +x bootstrap.sh ./bootstrap.sh
#+end_src

* Manual Usage
** Stow a package
This creates the symlinks for a specific application.
#+begin_src bash
stow <package_name>
#+end_src

** Unstow a package
This removes the symlinks.
#+begin_src bash
stow -D <package_name>
#+end_src

** Restow (Update links)
Useful if you've added new files to a package and need to refresh the links.
#+begin_src bash
stow -R <package_name>
#+end_src

* Troubleshooting
If you see a conflict error (e.g., ~* existing target is neither a link nor a
directory~), it means a physical file already exists where Stow is trying to
place a symlink.

1. *Backup* the existing file: ~mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak~
2. *Run* stow again: ~stow zsh~
3. *Verify*: Check the link with ~ls -l ~/.zshrc~
